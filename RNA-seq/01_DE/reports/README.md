Differential gene expression tables for comparisons between plants inoculated with *B. subtilis* and non-inoculated plants (incubation in MS30 medium).



* Monocultures\_EXP1\_leaf\_logFC\_padj\_TMMcpm.xlsx - Excel table with DEA results of Monocultures experiment leaf tissue
* Monocultures\_EXP1\_root\_logFC\_padj\_TMMcpm.xlsx - Excel table with DEA results of Monocultures experiment root tissue
* Interactions\_EXP2\_root\_logFC\_padj\_TMMcpm.xlsx - Excel table with DEA results of Interactions experiment root tissue
* Combined\_Results\_DEA.xlsx - Excel table with combined DEA results of Monocultures \& Interactions experiments





The tables include following data:

* Gene IDs
* MapMan ontology functional annotations and gene descriptions
* comparison log fold changes (logFC) and false discovery rate(FDR)-adjusted p-values
* log trimmed mean of M-values (TMM)-normalized counts per million (CPMs)





*B. subtilis* strains combinations for inoculation

* Monocultures experiment:: PS-216 YFP, PS-218 YFP, PS-218 mKate2
* Interactions experiment:: isogenic interaction: PS-218 mKate2 + PS-218 YFP; non-kin interaction: PS-218 mKate2 + PS-216 YFP
