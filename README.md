# Bacillus and Pti5

We have recently identified an ethylene response factor Pti5 as a susceptibility factor that negatively regulates immune response to diverse pathogens. Here, we investigated the processes involved in colonisation of potato with beneficial organisms.

## RNA-seq
- DE analysis
- GSEA
- Network analysis


## qPCR
- various qPCR data analysis: roots/shoots, mutants, mycorrhiza
- but also analysis of bacterial presence and AMF abundance
